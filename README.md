# CS-DSA-Course-Final-Project.

This repository contains an approach developed for CS Data Structures & Algorithm course project to get the Stern-Brocot number system representation for a given fraction using a Binary Search Tree in C++.

### Input :

The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case consists of a line contains two positive integers
m and n where m and n are relatively prime. The input terminates with a test case containing two 1â€™s
for m and n, and this case must not be processed.

### Output :

For each test case in the input, output a line containing the representation of the given fraction in
the Stern-Brocot number system.

### Sample Input :

5 7
878 323
1 1

### Sample Output :

LRRL
RRLRRLRLLLLRLRRR
